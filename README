Usage Overview
--------------

Basically, you must write a CGI script (whit the use of the CGI
module) with an active DBI connection. Then you use DBIx::Browse to
browse a given table. You can look at the file DemoDBIxBrowse to see
an example.

         use DBIx::Browse;
         my ($dbh, $dbb, $q);
         $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:Pg:dbname=enterprise")
           or croak "Can't connect to database: $@";
        $q   = new CGI;
        $dbb = new  DBIx::Browse({
           dbh => $dbh,
           table => 'employee',
           proper_fields => [ qw ( name fname ) ],
           linked_fields => [ qw ( department category office ) ],
           linked_tables => [ qw ( department category office ) ],
           linked_values => [ qw ( name       name     phone  ) ],
           linked_refs   => [ qw ( id         id       ide    ) ],
           aliases       => [ qw ( name fname department category phone )],
           primary_key   => 'id',
           cgi           => $q
       });
        print
           $q->start_html(
                          -title => "Test DBIx::Browse"
                          );
        $dbb->list_form({
           field_order  => [  1,  0,  4,  3,  2 ],
           field_length => [ 14, 15, 15, 15, 10 ]
        });

       ...etc
